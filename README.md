# coloRandom

Random color generator for all your artistic needs

## 📝 Description

This is a web application that helps discover new color palettes. This project was inspired by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). You can generate new color palettes or saving favorite palettes. It was built using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal of the project was to reinforce our HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills in a more complicated project. There was a focus on readable, clean, DRY, and SRP code. This project was a test in our team based skills.

## ✨ Features

- Generate a random color palette of 5 colors
- Lock colors to maintain them between each generation
- Save and delete palettes

## 🌱 Context

We are currently in Week 4 of Mod 1 Front-End Engineering. This is our second group project. In total we spent 9 hours working on this project together using paired programming.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Allowing sending saved palettes to the main page for editing.
- Ensure that all saved palettes are unique.
- Create a delete confirmation page.
- Implement localStorage so the saved palettes persist on page load.
- Allow users to name their palettes when saving, and allow them to search their saved palettes by name.
- Create a way for users to adjust a color.
- Generate colors based on actual color palettes instead of being completely random.
