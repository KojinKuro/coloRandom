# coloRandom

Random color generator for all your artistic needs

## 📝 Description

This is a web application that helps discover new color palettes. This project was inspired by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). You can generate new color palettes or saving favorite palettes. It was built using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal of the project was to reinforce our HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills in a more complicated project. There was a focus on readable, clean, DRY, and SRP code. This project was a test in our team based skills.
