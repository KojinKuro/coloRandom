# coloRandom

Random color generator for all your artistic needs

## 📝 Description

This is a web application that helps discover new color palettes. This project was inspired by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). You can generate new color palettes or saving favorite palettes. It was built using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal of the project was to reinforce our HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills in a more complicated project. There was a focus on readable, clean, DRY, and SRP code. This project was a test in our team based skills.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Practice working together with other developers to create  final product
- Work on implementing HTML, CSS, and Javascript to match a project spec
- Practicing proper git commit workflow

## 🏆 Wins and Challenges

### Wins

- Keeping the code clean and DRY
- Being able to work together with a team of other developers successfully

### Challenges

- Working with other team members with differing opinions on how to write code
- Being able to refactor and work with other people's code

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Ensure that all saved palettes are unique.
- Create a delete confirmation page.
- Implement localStorage so the saved palettes persist on page load.
- Allow users to name their palettes when saving, and allow them to search their saved palettes by name.
- Create a way for users to adjust a color.
- Generate colors based on actual color palettes instead of being completely random.
